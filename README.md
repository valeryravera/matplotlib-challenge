# matplotlib-challenge
Module 5 Challenge
This challenge was rather interesting working with data of this size and kind. I did struggle in the last few parts of the assignment but perservered. Thank you for taking a look and grading my assignment!

In the starter code file you will find the pymaceuticals_starter.ipynb file which is what I worked in. All my code and outputs can be found there.

Resources used: Help from instructional staff, ASKBCS classmates help and suggestions in our slack group "ask-you-classmates" channel. 

Resources used from the internet: 
  - Box plot: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/box-plot-in-python-using-matplotlib/
  - Matplotlib crash course: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Xc3CA655Y4

ASK BCS helped me with brushing up my code and troubleshooting errors with the outliers section and plotting my linear plot section as well.
